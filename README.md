# DecisionTree

DT is a flowchart like structure where each node denote a test on attribute, each branch denote an outcome of a test and each leaf node holds the class label

  1. Tree like a model for decision
  2. works well at both classification and Regression
  3. These tree spilt the data into multiple regions
  
code-
1. Load diabetes and iris dataset
2. check the pairplot
3. split the data
4. fit the model
5. check the metrics

Basically, DT follow the tree like a structure that contain root, branch and leaf nodes of data
